This is a little personal side project to practice ReactJS and Material-UI.
This project builds a web site to show R16 main draws of ITTF(International Table Tennis Foundation) world tours, and will show Youtube videos of each match inside a dialog after user click the node from SVG, and there is a Python crawler to get data of draws and video url.
